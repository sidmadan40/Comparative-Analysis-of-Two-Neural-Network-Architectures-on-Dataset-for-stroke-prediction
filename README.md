# Comparative-Analysis-of-Two-Neural-Network-Architectures-on-Dataset-for-stroke-prediction
 This work analyses the intricacies of two neural network architectures over the stroke occurrences dataset. A Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are the two algorithms being reviewed.
