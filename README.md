# Comparative-Analysis-of-Two-Neural-Network-Architectures-on-Dataset-for-stroke-prediction
 This work analyses the intricacies of two neural network architectures over the stroke occurrences dataset. A Feedforward Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are the two algorithms being reviewed. This is a supervised learning problem and these two approaches are the most standard neural network algorithms used for a binary classification prediction task. In a grid search approach, numerous models are tested while having their hyperparameters varied, and they are then validated via stratified cross-validation. Confusion matrices are used to compare the tested outcomes from the best-performing models. In most research problems where the interconnections between features and predicted variables are not that well defined, it has been evident that MLP trumps SVM and as the outcome of our analysis, the MLP algorithm has again emerged to be more effective for such classification problems.
